      <h3>What is this?</h3>
      <p>We are getting married! Turns out weddings are a great excuse to throw really fun parties. That's all this is; it's not a reception, but rather a chance to come have a lot of fun with a lot of fun people.</p>

      <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
      <p>Anything that will facilitate game and whimsy; e.g. your favorite t-shirt, a hawaiian button-down, or an American flag fanny pack.</p>

      <h3>So, where exactly is this?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/place/The+Underground+Social+Hall/@40.234585,-111.6612977,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x874d97534016e679:0xd716f8026d3c1b92!8m2!3d40.234585!4d-111.6591037?hl=en">The Underground Social Hall at Provo Town Square</a>. Look for stairs that go underground (appropriately). If parking on Center Street isn't working out, you could park in unmarked stalls in the parking garage on 100 W and enter through the stairs in the back. I'm totally winging those directions, but I think they're right. Or at least close enough.</p>

      <h3>What can I expect from this party?</h3>
      <p>Dancing, socializing, and some light refreshments. What not to expect: formal attire, long lines of people, rare exotic birds.</p>

      <h3>Do I need to bring anything?</h3>
      <p>Bring yourself and a good attitude, just like you learned in little league.</p>
